basic minesweeperBot walkthrough based on 1, 2, 3, 4 without the possibility of guessing
The project depends on the exact positioning of the game window (and window size). 
The project is designed for a window with a resolution of 1920x1080. The first cell is at 55;328. 
This script takes a screenshot of the window, and on it, by coordinates, checks what color the pixel has, 
based on this it builds a matrix corresponding to the cells of the field, and with simple 2000 line logic determines where to click.
The project was created at the start of programming after the first course because there is nothing to do, do not judge strictly, but a year later I can definitely do better, but why? Moreover, todolist can also be improved, but why!
